	        We assume an ideal three-phase stator current:
            \begin{equation}
                \begin{split}
                    i_\mathrm{s,a}(t) &= \hat{i}_{\mathrm{s}} \cos(\omega t), \\
                    i_\mathrm{s,b}(t) &= \hat{i}_{\mathrm{s}} \cos(\omega t - 2\pi/3), \\
                    i_\mathrm{s,c}(t) &= \hat{i}_{\mathrm{s}} \cos(\omega t + 2\pi/3).
                \end{split}
            \end{equation}
            The index 's' indicates stator quantities, but is omitted in the following as we will only consider stator quantities until further notice, i.e.,, 
            $$i_\mathrm{s,a}(t) = i_\mathrm{a}(t), \quad i_\mathrm{s,b}(t) = i_\mathrm{b}(t), \quad i_\mathrm{s,c}(t) = i_\mathrm{c}(t)$$
            and $\hat{i}_{\mathrm{s}}=\hat{i}$.
