            \begin{itemize}
                \item  Homopolar machines are the simplest form of electric machines.
                \item They are also true DC machines, as the current and flux paths are unidirectional.
                \item The general design prevents connecting multiple rotor turns in series to increase the voltage, that is, only a relatively low voltage is induced.
                \item Consequently, homolpolar machines require high currents (in the order of  \si{\kilo\ampere} or even \si{\mega\ampere}) to reach a useful power range which limited their application.

            Let's consider \figref{fig:Simple_yoke_coil} and assume that the flux density $B$ is constant in the air gap and that the conductor loop has a length $l$. According to the Lorentz force we have
			\begin{equation}
				F = i_\mathrm{A} B l .
			\end{equation}  
			The torque $T$ on the conductor loop is given by
			\begin{equation}
				T = 2 F \frac{d}{2} \cos\left(\alpha\right) = i_\mathrm{A} B l d \cos\left(\alpha\right).
			\end{equation}
			If the loop spins with an angular velocity $\omega$, mechanical power $P_\mathrm{me} = T\omega$ is produced. 
			\\[1em]
			\textbf{Question:} What is happening if the coil is outside the magnetic field?

            \begin{itemize}
				\item To ensure a quasi-continous torque, the current through the conductor loop(s) in the rotor must have a constant direction.
				\item This is achieved by using a commutator (brushes).
				\item Compared to homopolar machines, DC machines require a mechanical rectification of the current.

				\item To reduce the effective length per armature conductor loop, the winding can form multiple pole pairs $p$.
				\item This will reduce the inductance per loop which is beneficial for the commutation process.
				\item The stator excitation must meet the same number of pole pairs.
				\item Given some inner stator diameter $D_\mathrm{s}$, the resulting pole pitch is:
