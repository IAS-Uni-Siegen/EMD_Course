			While $\bm{H}$ depends on the free currents applied to an object, $\bm{B}$ depends on the material properties of the object. In free space (vacuum), the relation is linear and represented by the magnetic constant $\mu_0$:
            \begin{align}
                \bm{B} = \mu_0 \bm{H} \quad \mbox{with} \quad \mu_0 \approx \SI{4 \pi e-7}{\newton\per\ampere\squared}.
            \end{align}
            To boost $\bm{B}$ for a given $\bm{H}$, ferromagnetic materials are typically used. These materials have a high relative magnetic permeability $\mu_{\mathrm{r}}$:
            \begin{align}
                \bm{B} = \mu \bm{H} = \mu_0 \mu_{\mathrm{r}} \bm{H}.
                \label{eq:linear_permeability} 
            \end{align}
            Note that $\mu_{\mathrm{r}}$ is a dimensionless quantity and that \eqref{eq:linear_permeability} assumes linear and isotropic material behavior.
