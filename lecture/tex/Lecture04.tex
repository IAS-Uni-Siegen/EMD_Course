                A transformer is a static device that transfers electrical energy between two or more circuits through electromagnetic induction. It converts the AC voltage levels between inputs and outputs.   
            \end{varblock}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item While a transformer is sometimes called a ``static~machine'', it does not meet the formal definition of an electrical machine (compare first chapter).
                \item However, transformers share some working principles with electrical machines and are also often used as components of electrical power systems including drives.

		The dynamic transformer behavior can be represented by the ECD in \figref{fig:General_transformer_ECD}, which also considers the internal resistances of the windings. Applying Faraday's law, the resulting differential equations are:
		\begin{align}
			u_1(t) = R_1 i_1(t) + \frac{\mathrm{d}\psi_1(t)}{\mathrm{d}t}, \qquad u_2(t) = R_2 i_2(t) + \frac{\mathrm{d}\psi_2(t)}{\mathrm{d}t}. \label{eq:transformer_differential_equations}
		\end{align}
		Inserting \eqref{eq:flux_linkage_matrix_transformer} delivers:

		Rearranging \eqref{eq:transformer_differential_equations_matrix_form} gives the state-space representation of the transformer model
		\begin{equation}
			\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\bm{i}(t) = \bm{L}^{-1}\left(\bm{u}(t)-\bm{R}\bm{i}(t) \right)

		with
		$$ \renewcommand*{\arraystretch}{1.3} \bm{L}^{-1} = \frac{1}{L_1L_2 - M^2} \begin{bmatrix} L_2 & -M \\ -M & L_1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{\sigma} \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{L_1} &  \frac{-M}{L_1 L_2} \\ \frac{-M}{L_1 L_2} & \frac{1}{L_2} \end{bmatrix}.$$
		Above, $\sigma$ is the leakage coefficient defined as (compare also \eqref{eq:coupling_coefficient})
		\begin{equation}
			\sigma = \frac{L_1 L_2 -M^2}{L_1 L_2 } = 1 - \frac{M^2}{ L_1 L_2} = 1 - k^2 .
		\end{equation}
		Finally, the state-space representation of the transformer model is
		\begin{equation}
			\renewcommand*{\arraystretch}{1.3} 
			\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\bm{i}(t) = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{R_1}{\sigma L_1} & \frac{R_2 M}{\sigma L_1 L_2} \\ \frac{R_1 M}{\sigma L_1 L_2} & -\frac{R_2}{\sigma L_1} \end{bmatrix} \bm{i}(t) + \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{\sigma L_1} & -\frac{M}{\sigma L_1 L_2} \\ -\frac{M}{\sigma L_1 L_2} & \frac{1}{\sigma L_2} \end{bmatrix} \bm{u}(t) = \bm{A} \bm{i}(t) + \bm{B} \bm{u}(t) .

%% Steady-state of the single-phase transformer %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Steady-state modeling of the single-phase transformer}
		Assuming that the transformer operates in steady state and that all quantities are sinusoidal, the state-space model \eqref{eq:transformer_state_space_02} can be simplified and represented by complex phasors:
			$$x(t) = \hat{x} \cos(\omega_\mathrm{el} t+ \varphi_{\mathrm{x}}) = \mathrm{Re}\left\{\hat{x} e^{\iu (\omega_\mathrm{el} t + \varphi_{\mathrm{x}})}\right\}= \mathrm{Re}\left\{\underline{X} e^{\iu \omega_\mathrm{el} t}\right\}.$$
		From \eqref{eq:transformer_differential_equations_matrix_form} we recieve
		\begin{align}
			\bm{\underline{U}} = \begin{bmatrix} \underline{U}_1 \\ \underline{U}_2 \end{bmatrix} = \bm{R}\bm{\underline{I}} + \iu \omega_\mathrm{el} \bm{L}\bm{\underline{I}} = \bm{\underline{Z}}\, \bm{\underline{I} } = \begin{bmatrix} R_1 + \iu \omega_\mathrm{el} L_1 & \iu \omega_\mathrm{el} M \\ \iu \omega_\mathrm{el} M & R_2 + \iu \omega_\mathrm{el} L_2 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \underline{I}_1 \\ \underline{I}_2 \end{bmatrix}.
			\label{eq:transformer_steady_state_voltage_response}
		\end{align}
		For some given $\bm{\underline{U}}$ we can calculate the current phasors $\bm{\underline{I}}$ (i.e., the steady-state current response) by solving:
		\begin{align}
			\renewcommand*{\arraystretch}{1.3} 
			\bm{\underline{I}} = \bm{\underline{Z}}^{-1} \bm{\underline{U}} .
			\label{eq:transformer_steady_state_current_response}
		\end{align}
		Alternative scenarios can be also considered, e.g., defining $\underline{U}_1$ (input voltage) and $\underline{I}_2$ (load current) as given and solving for $\underline{I}_1$ and $\underline{U}_2$ by rearranging \eqref{eq:transformer_steady_state_voltage_response}. 
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Steady-state of the single-phase transformer (cont.) %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Steady-state modeling of the single-phase transformer (cont.)}
		Assuming that the transformer is not loaded ($I_2 = 0$) and that it is lossless ($R_1 = 0$), \eqref{eq:transformer_steady_state_voltage_response} simplifies to
		\begin{equation}
			\begin{bmatrix} \underline{U}_1 \\ \underline{U}_2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \iu \omega_\mathrm{el} L_1  \\ \iu \omega_\mathrm{el} M  \end{bmatrix} \underline{I}_1.
		\end{equation}
		The voltage transformation ratio in this case results in
		\begin{equation}
			\frac{U_1}{U_2} = \frac{\iu \omega_{\mathrm{el}} L_1 I_1}{\iu \omega_{\mathrm{el}} M I_1}  = \frac{L_1}{M}.
		\end{equation}
		Assuming further that the transformer is leakage-free ($L_{1,\sigma}=0$), the voltage transformation ratio simplifies to (compare also \eqref{eq:inductance_split})
		\begin{equation}
			\frac{U_1}{U_2} = \frac{L_1}{M} = \frac{\Lambda_{21}N_1^2}{\Lambda_{21}N_1 N_2} I_1 = \frac{N_1}{N_2}.
		\end{equation}
		Hence, this famous result is only valid for the abstract case of a lossless, leakage-free, and, unloaded transformer -- i.e., not applicable to real-world transformers.

%% Transformation of the secondary side variables %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Transformation of the secondary side variables}
		Sometimes it can be helpful to (mathematically) transform the secondary side variables to ease the mathematical analysis. This can be done by introducing the transformation factor $\alpha$:
		\begin{equation}
			u_2' = \alpha u_2, \qquad i_2' = \frac{1}{\alpha} i_2.
		\end{equation}
		Here, $u_2'$ and $i_2'$ are the transformed secondary side voltage and current, respectively. The primary voltage equation reads
		\begin{equation}
			\begin{split}
			u_1(t) &= R_1 i_1(t) + L_1 \frac{\mathrm{d}i_1(t)}{\mathrm{d}t} + M \frac{\mathrm{d}i_2(t)}{\mathrm{d}t}  = R_1 i_1 (t)+ L_1 \frac{\mathrm{d}i_1(t)}{\mathrm{d}t}  + \alpha M \frac{\mathrm{d}i_2'(t)}{\mathrm{d}t}  \\&= R_1 i_1(t) + L_1 \frac{\mathrm{d}i_1(t)}{\mathrm{d}t} + M' \frac{\mathrm{d}i_2'(t)}{\mathrm{d}t}
		\end{split}
		\end{equation}
		with the transformed mutual inductance $M' = \alpha M$. 
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Transformation of the secondary side variables (cont.) %%

			\Leftrightarrow \quad u_2'(t) &= \alpha^2 R_2 i_2'(t) + \alpha^2 L_2 \frac{\mathrm{d}i_2'(t)}{\mathrm{d}t} + \alpha M \frac{\mathrm{d}i_1(t)}{\mathrm{d}t}\\
			\Leftrightarrow \quad u_2'(t) &=  R'_2 i_2'(t) + L'_2 \frac{\mathrm{d}i_2'(t)}{\mathrm{d}t} + M' \frac{\mathrm{d}i_1(t)}{\mathrm{d}t}
		\end{split}
		\end{equation}
		with the transformed resistance $R'_2 = \alpha^2 R_2$ and inductance $L'_2 = \alpha^2 L_2$.

	Based on \eqref{eq:zero_sequence_currents_phase_transformer} the winding currents on the delta side becomes
	\begin{equation}		
			i_\mathrm{a} = i_0 + \frac{1}{3}\left(i_\mathrm{ab}-i_\mathrm{ca}\right), \quad i_\mathrm{b} = i_0 + \frac{1}{3}\left(i_\mathrm{bc}-i_\mathrm{ab}\right), \quad i_\mathrm{c} = i_0 + \frac{1}{3}\left(i_\mathrm{ca}-i_\mathrm{bc}\right).
	\end{equation}
	If the secondary side is connected in delta, the zero sequence current will result from
	\begin{equation}
		\phi_0 = \phi_\mathrm{a} + \phi_\mathrm{b} + \phi_\mathrm{c}  = 
		\phi(i_{1\mathrm{a}}, i_{2\mathrm{a}}, i_{20}) + \phi(i_{1\mathrm{b}}, i_{2\mathrm{b}}, i_{20}) +\phi(i_{1\mathrm{c}}, i_{2\mathrm{c}}, i_{20}) =0
	\end{equation}
	where $\phi(\cdot)$ is the (potentially nonlinear) magnetic flux function (e.g., including saturation).

		Each side of a three-phase transformer can be connected in:
		\begin{equation*}
			\mbox{Y/y: star connection,}\quad \mbox{D/d: delta connection,}\quad \mbox{Z/z: zigzag connection.}
		\end{equation*}
		The winding nomenclature is as follows:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item First upper case letter: primary side (high voltage)
			\item Second lower case letter: secondary side (low voltage)
			\item Number ($0\ldots 11$): phase deviation between the primary and secondary side in $^\circ 30$ steps
			\item Optional: N/n for neutral connection of  high/low side.
		\end{itemize}
