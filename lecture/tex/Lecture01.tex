			   An electrical machine is a device that \hl{converts electrical energy into  mechanical energy} or vice versa.

			\begin{itemize}
				\item Electrical energy is routed via machine's external wiring connected to the terminal box.
				\item Mechanical energy is transferred via the shaft (if it is a rotatory machine).

			\begin{defi}{Electrical drive}{elec_drive}
			   An electrical drive is a system that \hl{controls the torque, speed or position of an electrical machine} connected to some mechanical process.

			\begin{itemize}
				\item Integrates the 'stupid' electrical machine into an 'intelligent' controlled system.
				\item The energy source and mechanical process ('load') are not part of the drive system.
